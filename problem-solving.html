      <h2 class="subHeader">A simple Problem?</h2>
      <p>what was the <span class="fthat">Problem?</span></p>

      <p>
        there is no such thing as a simple problem,Its just a problem. So how we
        deal with this, is by breaking it down . in this case work oout what
        thwe problem actually is, and trying to work with it . its kinda like
        working in a deli and running out of ham, so you work around it ,
        basically what im trying to say is you got look around and see whats
        available. Ask around, ask on the web. The only thing I learned from
        this is that you have to shop around a little and find an answer to your
        problems.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subHeader">elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
      <p>
        elegantly solved? definitely not, my aplication of problem solving,
        basically comes down to trying everything , anad when that doesn't try
        googling it. I ask for help. try everying , at your disposal It was
        frustrating feeling helpless but part of the i proscess i guess. I
        learned how to effectively look up problem and how to apply the effects,
        basically how search and fix things. Also talking the problem out loud
        was definitely helpful, which surprised me.
      </p>

        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>

      <h3 class="superSub">Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        Loved this, kinda gave me guidlines on what i ad to do, really helped to
        break things down into smaller tasks to complete , but is annoying to
        have to delete after
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Trying something</h3>
      <p>
        Always tried to do something , usually something doesnt work. Just need
        more knowlege/ expeirence coding
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        Kinda used it , but more when i was really stuck. Tsalked my problems
        outloud , helped put things into perspective
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        Im very confident reading error messages, got so many of them that im
        not even phased by them
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Console.logging</h3>
      <p>
        Usually pretty confident att using them, but not so much during this
        sprint
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Googling</h3>
      <p>
        i had 37 tabs open just to find answers for this sprint, im pretty
        confident in my googling
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Asking your peers for help</h3>
      <p>
        i had to phone my friend , who is a junior programmer to help me at one
        stage, even he got stuck on it , s he went to his boss , a senior
        programmer who helped, he said it was kinda fun
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
        If anything i think i may haved asked the coach too many times, we are
        on a first name bases now
      </p>
      <h3 class="superSub">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
      <p>Kinda, it was more relief than refection</p>

      <h2 class="subHeader">
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The thing about getting stuck all the time, is that im not even slightly
        reluctant to ask for help now. At the start i was but you just get over
        yourself eventually, and just get on with it
