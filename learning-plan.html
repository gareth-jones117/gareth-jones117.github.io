      <h1>My Learning Path</h1>

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to become a senior software engineer, from there
        the skys the limit.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>
      <p>
        The biggest limitation to myself is that zzI ovrerthink about eerything
        snd usually make simple questions into something much bigger than they
        really are. Another limitation of my self is that, im the hardest
        working laziest perosn you will meet, im a bit of a paradox. My effort
        towards something is bound to how interesting i find something, If i
        find it super-dis-interesting i put minimal effort into it .
      </p>
      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        im a massive introvert so developing people skills would be a must. i
        mean being able to publically speak or present , my skills in this area
        are nill or even non existant
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives, What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you.
      </h2>
      <p>
        To the first point , i try to be be as kind and respective as possible,
        but also i try to manage the workload as best i can, i limit my day 8hrs
        max before i call it a day. Secondly If things are starting to get to me
        i will simply ask for help or take a day off or more likely an hour off
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        Discord for sure i will ask for help there, if i cant ask fro help there
        for whatever reason i will ask for help from my friend who has just
        recetly finished the course here at devacademy, if all else fails
        Youtube or even reddit will be my last port of call.
      </p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
      <p>Help and support when and if needed, also some advice now and again</p>
      <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes, apart from this week im free, but as everyone knows something
        always comes up, but i try to maintain that the course is more
        important. If something does come up i will let the Facilitators know.
