        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I still dont really feel like i have an ego, so not too sure what to
        write here.

        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Improving communication and collaborative efforts when working with
        othersm designing programs and websites that will be user friendly, ,
        lots of reflection.

        What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        learning about neuroplasticty was interesting, and ow taking breaks was
        not only okay but was recommended
      </p>
      <h2 class="subHeader">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        taking seriously, some of it just seemed silly. but now that im at the
        end stage of the foundations, i can i say that most of it is actually
        useful
      </p>
      <h2 class="subHeader">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        so we dont't turn out like arseholes, we want to be hired by companies.
        a company will be more willing to hire someone who will be a good fit
        with other people.
      </p>
      <h2 class="subHeader">
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Seems like a loaded question here, i fell like foundations should be
        more focused on programming, from sprint 2 to 5 the ramp up in
        diffficulty is indescribable. i feel like more time focusing on the
        basics and then steadily rampoing up ould have been better. i just dont
        think human skills at this stage is useful.
