      What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
      positioning?
    </h2>
    <p>All of these tags have some impact on the positioning of  on a page, some as we shall discuss have a more apparent or more 
      impactful on the positioning of elements. </p></br>
      <p>The first tag we should discuss is relative. Relative positioning means that it is relative to itself. You need to give it some other directions, such as right, left, 
        top or bottom; otherwise, it will remain in the same place as it started and will remain static. So instead if we write position: relative; right: 20px; 
        The element will move 20px to the right of where it began; this is super useful if you want an element in a particular spot on the webpage. It should be noted that
        With the use of the relative positioning, all other elements on the page will not be affected by the relative positioning; instead, it makes room for the element to move in. In other words, it doesn't affect the flow of the web page.  </p><br>
        <p>The second tag we shall now discuss is the absolute tag. The absolute tag is rather simple. Like the previously mentioned relative position attribute, the absolute attribute can be used to position elements. 
          exactly where you want them, but its positioning is not based on its original position like in the relative positioning. Instead, the element with an absolute will move towards the nearest postioned element. 
          This can cause some elements to overlap as the result attribute does not follow the flow of the webpage. </p><br>
        <p>Finally, fixed podtioning is where the element will remain basically in view and won't move even if the page is scrolled up or down; this can be useful for something like a navigation bar.
          or something similar; however,  it can cover up other elements and make them accessible. There are ways around this, such as simply making space for them or including a scroll. 
          snapping attribute (but I'm afraid that might be a bit too advanced for right now).
