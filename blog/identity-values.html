    <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
    <p>
      Im rather aweful when it comes to writting about myself but i will try. I
      try to be as ethical as possible , usually I aim to be a utilitarianist.
      But at times admittedly i can be quite self serving at time, but i think
      most people find themselves to be. <br /><br />
      I will not go into too much detail about this story to protect the
      identity of those involved, but last year we had to force/ask a flatmate
      to move. This is due to them having a psychotic episode involving
      destruction of property and a police standoff. We as a flat came together
      to try and help our flatmate deal with mental health to the best of our
      abilities; we voiced our concerns about them remaining in the house and
      not seeking professional help. But alas, forcing someone to leave their
      own residence is a decision that should not come lightly. Things went
      smoothly for a while, but like all things, this didn't last forever. The
      flatmate had yet another psychotic break, this time endangering another
      flatmate. After yelling and throwing things around the house, my flatmate
      got in his car and drove away, without a destination involved. The police
      found him walking to Hamilton the next day; their car was a good distance
      away from them; they must have run out of petrol and started walking from
      guess. It was clear that this living arrangement was not going to work, so
      I called first meeting to discuss him remaining in the flat. I voiced my
      serious concerns, which is still one of the hardest things I do. It came
      to the conclusion that either he left and got professional help or all the
      other flatmates would leave. Fortunately, the other flatmates were angry,
      and we asked them to leave. It was unethical on both sides, them remaining
      at the house and us asking them to leave. However, it was the only thing
      we could do to protect ourselves and make sure they were looked after in a
      professionally controlled environment.<br /><br />
      Im British, somewhat proud of this. I think it has instilled a sense of
      perseverance in the face of overwhelming opposition; the adage of keep
      calm and carry on is basically a British motto from the Battle of Britain
      (1940). I think about this motto often when I'm feeling slightly
      overwhelmed and don't know why, but it always lifts my spirits and pushes
      me forward. I can't explain it. Its almost like my English blood reacts to
      it. I think many of my values such as perseverance, honesty and above all
      my sense of humor has be created or shaped in some way by the very fact
      that im Britsh <br /><br />
      My strengths incluede a good sense of humor, i often see best side of
      things even when things are terrible. I see no point on dweliing on the
      negative and instead focus on the brighter side of things. I pride myself
      on beeing fair and open with others and always respect others. it make
      working as team easier . It should also be of note that im honest, another
      thing i pride my self on. Id rather say im stuck on a problem and ask for
      help rather than lieing and making it a bigger problem down the road. it
      should also be noted o9f my humilitym, as do not think my self better than
      other nor that im special in anyway whatso-ever. always dislike the idea
      of elitism, and try to distance myself and the best of times to this
      concept. Makes getting along with people alot easier "team work makes the
      dream work".<br /><br />
      My biggest limitaions will always be my lack of creativity, for example my
      website..its just black with some text that changes to green when you
      hover over it, best i can do , do think it looks a little retro..so thats
      cool i guess. This is something i need to work on, defintly but i have no
      idea where to even begin. Im a little reclusive and it takes a while for
      me to warm up to others and it takes even linger for me to speak my mind,
      usually i will just go with whatever the group are saying. it also shoulld
      be noted that i can at times, be stubbon. <br /><br />
      I cant really think of example of tension or resitance when i was working
      with a team, as i havent really done that since even before my college
      days. I always do my own work and i try my hardest to getalong with others
      .
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      Please note that i will be returning to this page to do some styling in
      the near future.
