          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
        </h2>
        <p>
          The relationship between JavaScript and HTML/CSS is an interesting
          reslationship to witness and write about. To describe this
          relationship, i think it would be best to imagine working as a painter
          on a canvas.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML is the basic sketch on the canvas. Its the essential structure of
          the painting, this is where we place objects and elements. Without
          this intial sketch, there would be no way of guiding trhe structing to
          the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS is the fun part, we can imagine it as the all the colors and brush
          strokes a painter would use to make the painting awesome and nice to
          look at. The same thing applies to the web page. With CSS we can add a
          creative flare to our elements on the page. Like for example changing
          the <span class="green">text to green</span> .</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally JavaScript could be considered the interactive part of the
          painting if there was one. Imagine being able to make the painted
          stars move on Van Gogh 
          <span class="starry">'The Starry Night'</span>. In otherwords
          JavaScript makes the elements more dynamic and interactive, and can
          change overtime.

        <h2 class="subHeader">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h2>
        <h3 class="subHeader">Control Flow</h3>
      <p>Control flow is kinda like getting up in the morning, you get up and you plan your day. You organise your day by listing task you need to complete during the day,  you organsise these task from the first to the last. Once you have created a list of tasks to doduring the day you got about comleteing them. 
        This basically what a control flow is. You run script and it is executed by the computer.   </p>
        
        <h2 class="subHeader" >Loops</h2>
        <p>
         loops are a function that will repeat some code over and over again as long as the conditions you write are correct or will stop when the conditions are met. 
         It kinda like taking your studying where there is a question you dont qute understand so you keep going over the material until you uinderstand it .

    <h2 class="subHeader">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h2>
    <section class="sect">
      <p> The DOM is a abbreviation for the Document Object Model. The DOM bassically connects web pages to the different 
        scripts and languages that we use, eg HTML. this gives it structure. This structure we can call the DOM tree.
         The DOM tree represents all the different nodes and elements that make up the structure of a page. 
         Javascript has the power to change any of the properties of these nodes by either adding to them, or you
         can even remove some of the elements, pretty cool if you ask me.</p>

  <h2 class="subHeader">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
  <section class="sect">
    <p>An array is a variable that can strore more than one value at a time  . Its like a list and each of the value in this list have an 
      index number/index position. The values that are stored in array are typically the same, for example different types of fruits or animals stuff like that .</p><br>
<div class="divImage2"><img src="assets-blog/arrayscreenshot.png" alt="An example of an array"></div>
      

<p> Where as an object is a collection of different values that are related to each other in some way or another. For example creating an employee in a datasheet , 
you would need to put their occupation, age and name . the object variable creates this all in one sitting and combines them into an object or a set of values . </p>

  <h2 class="subHeader">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
<p> A function is basically a statement in javascript that runs a task, unlike a tag in HTML which usually satic, functions can have many moving parts.
   In other words you define a function and it produces and an output. The cool thing about them is that you call them at any time in your code and they will run (hopefully)</p>
