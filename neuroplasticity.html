        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h2>
      <p>
        If we understand the principles of neuroplasticity, we can influence our
        brain development in a benificial/positive direction . The more we use
        our brain and the more we challenge it the longer our brain fuction at a
        high level.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="subHeader">
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I eliminate distractions for a set number of hours to increase my
        attention to the course, if we don't eliminate distractions we won't
        focus and will learn nothing. 
        <p>Writing these blogs and discussing the
        work that we've done during the weak helps reinforce the skills we've
        learnt throughout the week.</p>
        <P>Thinking about the rewards that will be
        generated from the completion of this course, evokes a positive
        emotions. Positive emotions not only make learning more enjoyable, but it
        has been proven to have affect on knowledge retention.</P>
        <p>Spacing the learning into smaller section is not only easier for us to understand , it is far better in terms of knowledge retention, 
          than say doing the entire course in a matter of weeks. It can be said that that by doing repeated learning will move learning we have conducted from short term memory to long term memory </p>
      </p>
      <h2 class="subHeader">What are some of the ways to increase your Neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p> Like any part of the body, the more we use a certain muscle the more it improves. The same can be said about the brain. 
        With the brain its more of a "use it or lose it" scenario. What i mean to say is, we need to challenge our selves in order for us to strengthen our brain. 
        A good way of doing this is by learning to do something new, like earn a language or taking breaks away from the course and doing something else, 
        for example for every hour I complete doing the course I take 20 minute breaks doing something else whether thats reading a chapter in a book or some manga, or in my case looking up how to 
        cook better. Another way that ive heard helps to increase Neuroplasticity is meditation, but i have yet to try this   </p>

    <h1 class="Header">Growth Mindset</h1>
    <section class="sect">
      <h2 class="subHeader"> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
      <p>
        The growth mindset is a way of viewing challenges and obstacles. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain tasks and skills , their abilities can improve with hard work. 
        I think this basically the course's way of telling us that although we kinda suck at coding now, we will get better overtime and not think that we wont get any better during the course .
      </p>
      <h2 class="sect">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <p> Surprised, perhaps not ? if anything im reassured. thought i was just terrible at coding, but i feel a little assured that i will get better.  </p>
      <h2 class="sect">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
      <p> Rise up to the challenge, but dont be afraid to ask for help. Baby steps to learning is important, we will all get there in the end, it just takes time and effort.

        a good quote to think about is <blockquote>"The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried". - Stephen McCranie </blockquote>

      <h1 class="Header">Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>
      <h2 class="subHeader">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. </h2>
      <p>
        Just thought that overtime i will get better , makes me believe that i can rise up to the challenge and get better it just gives me hope. also the idea that I need to 
        split things up and take my time with the different themes and ideas in the course is an acceptable truth. Trying to learn everything at once just insn't gonna work ,<div class=""></div> better to do short sprints rather than huge study runs.
